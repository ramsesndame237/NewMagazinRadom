Like the majority of countries in the CEMAC zone, Cameroon is governed by a system that very often puts its inhabitants in unpleasant situations; moments of pain that are at the origin of many losses of time and money. These situations are of several kinds, among which we can note as an example  The lack of knowledge by the users of the adequate structures to carry out their operations. This sometimes pushes some people to travel very long distances in vain. The case of those people who are rejected for jobs or in their place of service for lack of required documents or for non-conformity of some of these documents Travelling long distances, sacrificing time and money in search of information on government services and companies Scams of all kinds to which students and parents are subjected during the competition and registration periods in the different faculties and schools of our universities To answer these problems, many turn to the Internet but the classic search engines are not always able to provide such specific information especially for a restricted geographical area such as Cameroon. And when they have acquired this information, they frequently face long queues in the services.
